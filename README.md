# extension-default-assignments

An extension for LuckPerms v5, which implements the (now removed) default assignments functionality.

This allows users of the old system to update more seamlessly to the newer versions of the plugin.

This is not a long term solution, it exists merely to reduce some of the update burden on users. It is encouraged that users migrate away from this system.

To do so, consider exactly what purpose default assignments are having on your server, and try to find another approach to the problem. We're more than happy to help with ideas etc in the project Discord server.

### Usage

Just install the extension as you would any other, and configure the default assignments as normal in the main LuckPerms configuration file.
